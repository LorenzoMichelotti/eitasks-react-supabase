# Task management web app

Im building this website because i felt the need for a better experience using task apps, to me they all feel a bit bland and boring to use. With this project I hope to can build a simple and optimized, novel task management interface with #NextJs, #Tailwindcss, #RadixUI and #Zustand.

You can access the app at https://lolo-tasks.vercel.app/
